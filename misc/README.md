D_mel_transposon_sequence_set.fa
-----------------------------------

This file was used in [Sackton et al (2009)](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/1/449.full)
and was created by modifying the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project's TE data set (v9.4.1) to 
1) include the class/subclass of each family and 2) remove any TE sequences not from D. melanogaster. 
LTR elements are represented by a single entry. There are 128 entries in this file.

---------------------------
This file was used in [MÃ©ndez-Lago et al. (2011)](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/7/1967.full) 
and was created from RepBase Update (29 Jun 2009) with names converted to official FlyBase symbols. This 
file includes TEs from Drosophila species besides D. melanogaster. LTR elements are represented by _I and _LTR entries
for the internal and LTR components respectively.  The class/subclass of each family is not annotated. There
are 419 entries in this file.
