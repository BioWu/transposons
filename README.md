TRANSPOSON SEQUENCE CANONICAL SETS FOR DROSOPHILA
===========

This repository contains 'canonical' sequences of the transposable elements
from Drosophila.

History: These sequences were originally compiled by Takis Benos (EBI),
Leyla  Bayraktaroglu (Harvard) and Michael Ashburner (EBI & Cambridge)
with help from Aubrey de Grey (Cambridge), Joe Chillemi (Harvard) and
Martin Reese (LBNL). We thank Suzi Lewis (Berkeley) for inspiration and
discussion, Guochun Liao (Berkeley) for his repeat sequence set and
newly discovered transposable element sequences from the Berkeley P1
clones, and Lynn Crosby (Harvard) for her annotations of some elements.

Subsequent curation of these sequences has been in the context of the
Drosophila Genome Project and was a collaboration between M. Ashburner
(Cambridge), Josh Kaminker (Berkeley) and Casey Bergman (Berkeley).  From
Version 8.0 this set has been maintained by Michael Ashburner and Casey
Bergman in Cambridge. The last version updated by Michael Ashburner was 
Version 9.411. FlyBase generated version 9.42 from these files in 2009, 
which have not been updated since. From version v9.43 onwards, this set 
has been under continuous version control on by Casey Bergman (Manchester)

We thank Margi Butler, Elena Casacuberta, Madeline Crosby, Bob Levis,
Mary-Lou Pardue, Kevin O'Hare, Horacio Naveira, Dmitri Petrov, Steve
Schaeffer, Todd Schlenke, Alfredo Villesante & the authors of REPBASE for
sequences and/or annotations.
