TRANSPOSON SEQUENCE CANONICAL SETS FOR DROSOPHILA
===========

This repository contains 'canonical' DNA sequences of the transposable 
elements from species in the genus Drosophila.

History: These sequences were originally compiled by Takis Benos (EBI),
Leyla Bayraktaroglu (Harvard) and Michael Ashburner (EBI & Cambridge)
with help from Aubrey de Grey (Cambridge), Joe Chillemi (Harvard) and
Martin Reese (LBNL). We thank Suzi Lewis (Berkeley) for inspiration and
discussion, Guochun Liao (Berkeley) for his repeat sequence set and
newly discovered transposable element sequences from the Berkeley P1
clones, and Lynn Crosby (Harvard) for her annotations of some elements.

Subsequent curation of these sequences has been in the context of the
Drosophila Genome Project and was a collaboration between M. Ashburner
(Cambridge), Josh Kaminker (Berkeley) and Casey Bergman (Berkeley).  From
Version 8.0 this set has been maintained by Michael Ashburner and Casey
Bergman in Cambridge. The last version updated by Michael Ashburner was 
Version 9.411 and is available [here](https://github.com/cbergman/transposons/blob/master/personal_communications/ashburner/transposon_sequence_set.v.9.411).

FlyBase made minor modifications to Version 9.411 to generate
[version 9.42](ftp://ftp.flybase.net/releases/FB2013_01/precomputed_files/transposons/transposon_sequence_set.embl.txt.gz) 
in 2009, which is the most recent release available at FlyBase. A copy of 
9.42 is available [here](https://github.com/cbergman/transposons/tree/master/releases/transposon_sequence_set.embl.txt)
 
From Jan 2013 (version version 9.43 onwards), this dataset has been under continuous version control
by Casey Bergman (University of Manchester) at: https://github.com/cbergman/transposons/. The major changes
from version 9.42 to 9.43 are to separate the metadata into a separarte README file and 
add TART-A, TART-B, and TART-C DNA sequences.

Versions 9.42, 9.43 and subsequent releases of this dataset can be found in 
https://github.com/cbergman/transposons/releases/. The most up-to-date version of the dataset 
can be found in https://github.com/cbergman/transposons/current, which may contain additional
improvements to the dataset that have not yet been incorporated into an official release.

Schaeffer, Todd Schlenke, Alfredo Villesante & the authors of REPBASE for
